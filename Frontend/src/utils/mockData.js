Welcome to this comprehensive guide on building modern React applications with Vite!

## What is Vite?

Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup

## Why Choose Vite?

### âš¡ Lightning Fast
- Instant server start
- Lightning fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- True on-demand compilation

### ðŸ”§ Rich Features
- TypeScript support out of the box
- CSS pre-processors support
- Framework agnostic core

## Getting Started

First, create a new Vite project:

\`\`\`bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

That's it! You now have a blazing fast React development environment.

## Conclusion

Vite represents the future of frontend tooling. Its speed and simplicity make it an excellent choice for React projects of any size.`,

    content: `# The Art of Minimalist Web Design

In a world of visual noise and information overload, minimalist web design stands as a beacon of clarity and purpose.

## Core Principles

### Less is More
Every element should serve a purpose. Remove anything that doesn't add value to the user experience.

### White Space is Your Friend
Don't fear empty space. It gives your content room to breathe and helps users focus on what matters.

### Typography Matters
Choose fonts carefully. Great typography can make or break a minimalist design.

## Benefits of Minimalism

- **Faster Loading**: Fewer elements mean faster page loads
- **Better UX**: Users can focus on what's important
- **Mobile Friendly**: Simpler designs work better on small screens
- **Timeless**: Minimalist designs age better than trendy ones

## Implementation Tips

1. Start with content, then add design
2. Use a limited color palette
3. Choose quality over quantity
4. Test with real users

Remember: Minimalism isn't about having less for the sake of itâ€”it's about having just enough.`,

    content: `# Building APIs with Node.js and Express

Learn how to create robust, scalable APIs using Node.js and Express framework.

## Setting Up Express

First, let's create a basic Express server:

\`\`\`javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(\`Server running on port \${PORT}\`);
});
\`\`\`

## Key Concepts

### Middleware
Middleware functions execute during the request-response cycle:

\`\`\`javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request received:', req.method, req.path);
  next();
});
\`\`\`

### Routing
Organize your routes for better maintainability:

\`\`\`javascript
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/users', getAllUsers);
router.post('/users', createUser);
router.get('/users/:id', getUserById);

app.use('/api', router);
\`\`\`

### Error Handling
Always implement proper error handling:

\`\`\`javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong!' });
});
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Use environment variables** for configuration
2. **Validate input data** before processing
3. **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
4. **Add rate limiting** to prevent abuse
5. **Use HTTPS** in production
